## Hi there 👋 I'm JohnNesha

I'm a Software QA Engineer transitioning into a Software Engineer role, and I'm super excited about the journey!  I've spent 4 years honing my skills in testing and quality assurance, developing a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the software development lifecycle. Now, I'm ready to leverage that experience to build amazing things.  🚀

My Passion:  I'm passionate about crafting clean, functional, and user-friendly webpages.  I find immense satisfaction in taking an idea from concept to a fully realized web presence.  Right now, I'm actively building webpages and learning Python to enhance my skillset even further.  🐍💻

Beyond the Code: 🤓

When I'm not immersed in the world of code, you can find me:

∙ Reading:  I love losing myself in a good book 📚 <br/>
∙ Learning: I'm a lifelong learner, always eager to explore new technologies and expand my knowledge. 🧠 <br/>
• Working Out: Staying fit and healthy is important to me. 💪
